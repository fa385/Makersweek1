1. what role does trhe name of the file play with the testing, as long as the require part is correct is that all that is needed?
2. need to find out what was wrong with COuntingg filed and then make it work. I think it has to do with congruency with regards to the names given to the file and the local variables within the class and fiule names expected by rspec
or it could also be due to not filling in every part of the class object

3. why does this =>  not work, but this .delete('.­!?,') does

4. text = "my rando­m sente­nce..,.!?"
word = text.split(" ").delete("my")
puts wordgivving the result of my??
